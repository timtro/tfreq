# `tfreq`—A legacy project

*Software to compute vibrational density of states from molecular dynamics data.*

I wrote this program in 2008. I was just starting to switch to C from using
Fortran 77 as my every-day language. (Yeah, I know, right?)

Thirteen years later, I now consider myself a proper programmer. So as a fun
side-project, I thought I would rewrite this program.

So, this project is in an intermediate state. I'm going to redevelop it slowly
in my spare time. So:

```
⚠️  WARNING ⚠️  This project is in an intermediate state.
```

If you're a prospective employer, please, do not consider this as an example of
my work. This is what I was writing over a decade ago when I didn't take
programming seriously as its own art and science.


## Why?

I recall at the time that there was no software out there for doing this
calculation, and it was difficult to find papers that ever described it. I
recall one by Jorge Hohanoff:

> **Phonon spectra from short non-thermally equilibrated molecular dynamics simulations**
> *Kohanoff, Jorge*
> ISSN: 0927-0256 , 1879-0801; DOI: 10.1016/0927-0256(94)90103-1
> Computational materials science , 1994, Vol.2(2), p.221-232

which was impossible to find. I had to write Prof. Hohanoff who kindly mailed me
one of his personal copies.

It's probably a lot easier now, and there is probably good software built into
tools like Quantum-ESPRESSO. But I thought I would put this up, just in case.
