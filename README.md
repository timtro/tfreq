# `tfreq`—A legacy project

“Software to compute vibrational density of states from molecular dynamics
data.”

I started writing this program in 2008. I was just starting to switch to C from
using Fortran 77 as my every-day language. (Yeah, I know, right?)

Thirteen years later, I now consider myself a proper programmer. So as a fun
side-project, I thought I would rewrite this program.

## Why?

I recall at the time that there was no software out there for doing this
calculation, and it was difficult to find papers that ever described it. I
recall one by Jorge Hohanoff:

> **Phonon spectra from short non-thermally equilibrated molecular dynamics simulations**
> *Kohanoff, Jorge*
> ISSN: 0927-0256 , 1879-0801; DOI: 10.1016/0927-0256(94)90103-1
> Computational materials science , 1994, Vol.2(2), p.221-232

which was impossible to find. I had to write Prof. Hohanoff who kindly mailed me
one of his personal copies.

It's probably a lot easier now, and there is probably good software built into
tools like Quantum-ESPRESSO. But I thought I would put this up, just in case.
